# automationProject

This project was developed as part of a degree coursework exam for the course of Fundamentals of Automatic Control during the second year of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering.

The project entails the utilization of Maple and Matlab for the analysis of a linear and time-invariant continuous-time system. Furthermore, it involves designing and discussing the Bode plot for a transfer function and determining a simple-structure controller for a feedback control scheme.
