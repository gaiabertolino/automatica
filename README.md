The project has been developed as the final assignment for the course on Fundamentals of Automatic Control, offered during the second year of the undergraduate program in computer engineering at the University of Calabria. The project entails the utilization of Maple and Matlab for the analysis of a linear and time-invariant continuous-time system. Furthermore, it involves designing and discussing the Bode plot for a transfer function and determining a simple-structure controller for a feedback control scheme.
